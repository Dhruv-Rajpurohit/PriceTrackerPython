# PriceTrackerPython



In this project, I implemented a python based web scrapper which fetches a price of a particular item from the e-commerce platform like Amazon and when the price reaches a particular threshold or satisfies user`s condition, it sends an email with the purchase link to the user.

Programming Language used: Python
Frameworks and Tools: BeautifulSoup, Requests module to Scrap the info.
